                    Active galactic nuclei (AGN) are supermassive black holes that reside at galactic centers and are actively accreting matter. In approximately 10% of cases, AGN produce relativistic jets: collimated streams of particles that travel for thousands of light years and have been detected at TeV energies by ground-based gamma-ray observatories. However, the mechanisms that accelerate particles beyond the TeV scale are largely unknown. Currently, only 56 objects are confirmed to accelerate particles to these extreme energies. Here we provide a selection of over 150 sources that exhibit infrared (IR) and X-ray emission profiles similar to those of the 56 TeV sources. In performing this selection, we develop new constraints on the IR and X-ray emissions of TeV-emitting sources using data from the ALLWISE catalog and the eROSITA-DE Data Release 1. We compare our candidates to existing catalogs interested in selecting TeV-emitting AGN and find a selection of 35 previously unidentified candidate sources for extreme particle emission. Within this selection, 32 of these sources are not detected by Fermi-LAT as gamma-ray sources, despite exhibiting IR and X-ray emission profiles characteristic of TeV sources. With further study, these 32 sources will motivate a correlation between the X-ray and TeV emissions of AGN. TeV observations of the candidates proposed in our work will unveil new constraints on the emissions of relativistic jets. With improved constraints, better theoretical models of particle acceleration within relativistic jets can be developed, and our understanding of galactic/black hole evolution and structure formation in the universe can be refined.

                    While all Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) commonly vary in X-ray emission on short time scales, it has been noted by several papers that this flux variability seems to be inversely correlated with the mass of the black hole (e.g., Lu & Yu 20014; Papadakis 20048; McHardy et al. 20065). This correlation implies that black holes with greater variability are less massive (~10^6M "â˜‰"). Therefore, if X-ray variability is great and the black hole is accreting near its Eddington limit, it can be inferred that this is a growing black hole. Our research focuses on a dataset of the AGN 2MASX J20082452-444095 that spans several years (2011-2019) and was collected with the X-ray telescope onboard the Swift satellite. We study the long-term X-ray variability of J2008 in order to understand the growth rate of its central black hole.
