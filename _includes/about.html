                <hr class="light">
                <p class=> I grew up in Oak Park, IL, 9 miles west of Chicago, and fell in love with space while visiting <a href = "https://www.adlerplanetarium.org/"> Adler Planetarium</a>. Currently, I am a 4th year astrophysics major at <a href= "https://washu.edu/"> Washington University in St. Louis (WashU)</a> intending to pursue a Physics PhD.</p>
                <p class = > I work in <a href = "https://sites.wustl.edu/errando/" > Dr. Manel Errando</a>'s experimental high-energy astrophysics lab where I research <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Active_galactic_nucleus" > Active Galactic Nuclei </a>. I specialize in X-ray data analysis and focus specifically on the relativistic jets generated by <a href= "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BL_Lacertae" > BL Lacertae (Bl Lac) </a> objects.</p>

                <p Throughout my academic career, I have been fortunate to have had incredible mentors who have made my successes possible. But, as the majority of students do not share my good fortune, I am passionate about expanding mentorship opportunities particularly for women, neurodivergent studnets, low-income students, and students of color. Currently, I provide physics education as a <a href="https://physics.wustl.edu/PLTL"> Peer-Led Team Learning (PLTL)</a> leader and as a recitation leader for students in WashU's introductory physics courses. Additionally, I run an outreach program that allows physics undergraduates to provide science demonstrations for a 5th grade class. Furthermore, as President of WashU's chapter of the <a href= "https://physics.wustl.edu/sps">Society of Physics Students (SPS)</a>, I work to provide resources for undergraduates interested in Physics and Astronomy. </p>

                <p> Outside of physics, I enjoy the more artistic pursuits of writing and painting. As a writing minor at WashU, I greatly enjoy writing creative fiction and poetry. </p>
